Testing:

Last year, at a software conference session Q&A, someone else asked a really good question.

"How do you start testing when you have none?"

Jump to about 59 minutes in that video to hear when it is asked and for the response.

I was in the audience there and I really liked this question.  I have dealt with this situation before.  Working in a legacy code base with only manual testing, then adding the first few automated unit and integration tests.
